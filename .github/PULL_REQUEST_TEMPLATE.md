**For short term contributors:** we understand that getting your commits well
defined like we require is a hard task and takes some learning. If you
look to help without wanting to contribute long term there's no need
for you to learn this. Just drop us a message and we'll take care of brushing
up your stuff for merge!

After you submit your pull request, **DO NOT click the 'Update Branch' button.
